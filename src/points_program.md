# LTV Protocol Points program

## Overview

The **LTV Protocol Points program** is a loyalty and engagement system designed to reflect participation activity for users contributing liquidity to the protocol.  
It reflects both **commitment** and **duration** of participation, aligning incentives between the protocol and its community.

## Program objectives

The Points Program is built to:

- Encourage long-term liquidity provision.  
- Recognize active community members who support early stages of the protocol.  
- Create a transparent metric for user contribution and engagement.  

Points are a **measure of contribution and loyalty** — reflecting both **how much** and **how long** liquidity has been provided.

## Earning Points

### Base Points

Participants accumulate base points automatically through:

- **Liquidity Amount:** The volume of assets deposited into LTV Protocol vaults.  
- **Holding Duration:** The length of time liquidity remains deposited without withdrawal.

Both metrics will be calculated continuously to ensure fair and transparent distribution.

### Multipliers

Points can be **boosted** through specific multipliers that reflect early or extended participation.

| Multiplier Type | Description | Boost |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| **42 NFT Holder Bonus** | Exclusive multiplier for holders of 42 NFTs. | **+42%** |
| **Duration Multiplier** | Additional bonus for maintaining deposits over extended periods. | TBD |
| **Partner or Campaign Multipliers** | Future event-based or partner-specific bonuses. | TBD |

Further multipliers and conditions will be announced closer to the public mainnet release.

## Points calculation formula

The total number of points earned by a participant is determined by the following formula:
```
Total Points = Base Points (Liquidity × Duration) × (1 + ΣMultipliers)
```
Where:
- **Base Points** reflect the combination of deposit size and time held.  
- **ΣMultipliers** represents the sum of all applicable percentage boosts (e.g., +42% from NFT).  

Formula subject to adjustment prior to final point program release.

## Participation rules

- **Automatic enrollment:** Any wallet interacting with LTV Protocol vaults after the program launch becomes eligible to participate
- **Transparency:** User balances and total leaderboard rankings will be publicly viewable via the LTV Protocol interface after launch.  
- **Non-transferable:** Points are tied to wallet activity and cannot be sold, transferred, or delegated.  

## Relation to 42 NFT

The **42 NFT** is directly integrated with the Points program.  
Holders receive a **+42% multiplier** on all points earned.  
It also grants early access to the closed beta phase, allowing holders to participate in the point phase earlier than the general public.
