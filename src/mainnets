### [wstETH ↔ ETH Vault 12x on AAAVE](./pilot vault.md)

The wstETH ↔ ETH Vault is the LTV Protocol’s first production vault, enabling leveraged staking on Ethereum using wstETH as collateral and borrowing ETH from AAVE v3. The vault targets 12× leverage on Ethereum Mainnet, built on AAVE v3’s lending market and Lido’s wstETH.
