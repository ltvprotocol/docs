# Gate 42

Early access gate for 42 NFT holders

Gate 42 is a snapshot + signature generator utility used to create on-chain whitelists for holders of the 42 NFT collection. It enables off-chain eligibility determination (via block snapshots) and on-chain verification signatures to grant early access privileges for protocol features gated by NFT ownership.

The 42 NFT is the official limited-edition access token of the LTV Protocol — holders enjoy priority access to early vaults and ecosystem unlocks such as Stage 3 gating.
